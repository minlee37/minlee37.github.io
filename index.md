### Predictions of Particulate Matter

Making accurate predictions of particulate matter (PM) is a crucial task as PM is currently considered to have the strongest correlation with the effects of cardiovascular disease. In this project, I built predictions models based on multi-layer perceptron (MLP) and long short-term memory (LSTM) to predict PM levels.
